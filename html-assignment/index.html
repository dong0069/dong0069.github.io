                <p>My name is Ailin Dong (<abbr title="Ailin Dong">AD</abbr>), and I am an international student studying in Canada. I was born in <em>Shanghai, China</em>. I have completed my high school education in Canada and I am currently studying at Algonquin College for my 1<sup>st</sup> year. My goal is to achieve professional success at an early stage and become an independent individual.</p>
                <p>I have a strong interest in art-related courses, particularly in <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>painting</strong>. Drawing is my talent, and I frequently enhance my skills in iPad drawing through online learning. Every time I complete a piece of artwork, I experience a great sense of achievement. This creative process brings me immense satisfaction, and I aspire to continue producing even better works.</p>
